# rsomeip

A Rust implementation of AUTOSTAR's [Scalable service-Oriented MiddlewarE over IP (SOME/IP)](https://some-ip.com/).

## Overview

This library enables Rust applications to communicate with other applications using SOME/IP, a message-based Inter-process Communication (IPC) protocol developed for the automotive industry.

SOME/IP supports a wide range of middleware features, most notably:

- Serialization – transforming data into and from on-wire representation.
- Remote Procedure Call (RPC) – remote invocation of functions.
- Service Discovery – dynamically finding and configuring services.

An overview of the protocol's features can be found [here](https://some-ip.com/details.shtml).

*Disclaimer: This project is highly experimental and makes no guarantees of correctly supporting the SOME/IP protocol, at this time.*
